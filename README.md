# LeetCode Problem Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various problems from LeetCode. Each problem has its own folder, and within each folder, you can find multiple solution files for the same problem. Additionally, each problem folder includes a README file that explains the different runtimes, space complexity, and algorithms used for the solutions.

## Folder Structure

The repository follows the following folder structure:

- problem-1
 - solution-1.py
 - solution-2.py
 - solution-3.py
 - README.md


## Problem Folders

Each problem is organized within its own folder, named after the problem. For example, `problem-1` represents the first problem from LeetCode. Inside each problem folder, you will find multiple solution files.

## Solution Files

Inside each problem folder, you will find multiple solution files. These files represent different approaches or solutions to the given problem. The filenames may vary depending on the steps used, such as `solution-1.py`, `solution-2.py`, etc.

## README File

Each problem folder includes a README file that provides additional information about the problem and its solutions. The README file includes the following information:

- Problem description or summary
- Algorithm(s) used to solve the problem
- Runtimes and space complexities of each solution
- Instructions on how to run or test the solutions
- Any additional notes or considerations

Please refer to the README file inside each problem folder for detailed information about the problem and its solutions.

## Contribution
